# DatabaseWebsite

This project was for the Database Theory and Application class held in Spring '19 at University of Central Missouri.
The professor in charge of this class is Dr Song Lin Tian. 

The goal of this project was to allow the students to learn how to perform insert, update, delete and view functions in a database. 
A basic UI is also used and the webpage and database is hosted using XAMPP.
